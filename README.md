# Loan-Calculator

A project from the Modern Javascript course

## Issues I ran into

- The calculated thing didn't display on my form.

  - I used javascript to remove the disabled attribute
  - ```
        monthlyPayment.disabled = false;
        // monthly payment is a form value
    ```

- The display is going on and off and I can't solve it still.
